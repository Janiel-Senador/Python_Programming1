    "(a) Prompt: \n",
    "Write Python classes for a vehicle system: 1. Base class Vehicle with color, mileage, fuel_liters attributes 2. Methods: drive(km, km_per_liter) that increases mileage and decreases fuel (never below 0) 3. Method: refuel(liters) that adds fuel 4. Child classes Car and Truck that inherit from Vehicle 5. Truck should override a method to show different behavior (e.g., less fuel efficient) 6. Include __init__, __str__ methods 7. Add type hints and docstrings 8. Include a test script showing inheritance benefits Show how inheritance avoids code duplication.\n",
